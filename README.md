# User Application Layer
.The user interacts with the application via a mobile client.
.This interacts with the User Application Layer, which includes:

# Elastic Load Balancer: 
.Distributes incoming traffic among multiple instances of AWS Lambda functions.

# AWS Lambda:
.Serverless compute service for executing code. This is likely where the user's requests are processed, fetching data from various services.

# Microservices Layer

.API Gateway: Handles API calls and manages access control to the microservices.

The Microservices Layer comprises these services:

## Search Layer:
Uses a search engine (likely Elasticsearch)

## API Gateway: 
Handles API calls and manages access control to the microservices.

The Microservices Layer comprises these services:

.Search Layer: Uses a search engine (likely Elasticsearch) to power product search functionality.

.Product Service: Manages data and operations related to product catalog and inventory. Likely uses MongoDB for data storage.

.Order Service: Processes orders, manages order status, and interacts with payment gateways. Likely uses PostgreSQL for data storage.

.Inventory Service: Tracks inventory levels, manages stock updates, and coordinates with the product service. Likely uses Amazon S3 for data storage.

# Payment Service: 
.Processes payment transactions and integrates with payment gateways.

# Recommendation Engine:
Provides personalized recommendations based on user data and browsing history.

# Database Layer
.The Database Layer is where data is stored and managed:
.Amazon RDS: Managed relational database service, likely used for storing critical user data, orders, and potentially product information.

## DynamoDB:
.NoSQL database, often used for high-volume, low-latency data storage such as session data, user preferences, or real-time updates.

## ElastiCache:
.In-memory caching service, used to store frequently accessed data for faster retrieval.

# Security Layer
â€¢ The Security Layer ensures application security:

## Security Layer

The Security Layer ensures application security:

.AWS CloudWatch: Monitoring service for tracking performance metrics and identifying potential issues.

.AWS IAM: Identity and Access Management service, used to control access to AWS resources.

.AWS WAF: Web Application Firewall, protecting against common web attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
